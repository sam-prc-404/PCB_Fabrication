## üìã Materials Needed

- **Copper-clad PCB**: A board coated with copper.
- **Laser printer**: For printing the PCB design.
- **Glossy paper**: Special toner transfer paper or glossy magazine paper.
- **Etching solution**: Ferric chloride or ammonium persulfate.
- **Iron or laminator**: For transferring the toner.
- **Acetone or isopropyl alcohol**: For cleaning the board.
- **Drill**: For making holes in the PCB.
- **Protective gear**: Gloves and goggles.

### 1. Design the PCB Layout
- Use PCB design software (e.g., KiCAD, Eagle) to create your circuit layout.
- Export the design as a **mirrored** PDF or image file.  (on some cases)

### 2. Print the Design
- Print the design on glossy paper using a laser printer at the highest quality settings.

### 3. Prepare the Copper Board
- Cut the board to size.
- Rub sandpaper on the copper-clad to remove oxidation and grease. 
- Clean the copper-clad board with acetone or isopropyl alcohol.

### 4. Transfer the Toner
- Place the printed design face down on the copper board.
- Use an iron (high setting, no steam) or a laminator to apply heat and pressure for **2-5 minutes**.

### 5. Remove the Paper
- Soak the board in warm water to loosen the paper.
- Gently rub off the paper, leaving the toner on the copper.

### 6. Etch the PCB
- Prepare the etching solution according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Submerge the board in the etching solution, agitating gently until unwanted copper is removed.

### 7. Rinse and Clean
- Rinse the board thoroughly with water to stop the etching process.
- Remove the toner with acetone or isopropyl alcohol.

## üí° Tips for Success
- Press the IRON FRMLY !! dont slack out on toner transfer step.
- Use high-quality glossy paper for better toner transfer.
- Experiment with etching times and solutions for optimal results.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Precautions
- Work in a well-ventilated area when using chemicals.
- Dispose of etching solutions according to local regulations.
- Always wear gloves and goggles for protection.
