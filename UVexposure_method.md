## üõ†Ô∏è Materials Needed

- **Copper-clad PCB**: A board coated with copper.
- **Photoresist**: A light-sensitive material.
- **UV Light Source**: For exposing the photoresist.
- **Developer Solution**: For developing the photoresist.
- **Etching Solution**: Ferric chloride or ammonium persulfate.
- **Drill**: For making holes in the PCB.
- **Protective gear**: Gloves and goggles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps for PCB Fabrication

### 1. Design the PCB Layout
- Use PCB design software (e.g., KiCad, Eagle) to create your circuit layout.
- Export the design as a negative film or a transparent PDF.

### 2. Prepare the Copper Board
- Clean the copper-clad board with acetone or isopropyl alcohol.

### 3. Apply Photoresist
- Coat the clean copper board with a layer of photoresist and allow it to dry.

### 4. Expose the Photoresist
- Place the negative film over the photoresist-coated PCB and expose it to UV light.

### 5. Develop the Photoresist
- Immerse the board in a developer solution to wash away the unexposed photoresist.

### 6. Etch the PCB
- Submerge the board in the etching solution until the unwanted copper is removed.
